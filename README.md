* m0 = Up-Up scattering, m1 = Down-Down scattering, m2 = Up-Down scattering, and m3 = Down-Up scattering, where Up and Down refer to the neutron's spin relative to the net magnetization before and after interacting with the sample.
* This model is meant for hexagonally-packed, magnetic, core-shell nanoparticles where their preferred magnetization direction is determined as a funciton of local packing anisotropy (dipolar interactions) and Zeeman energy.
* Additional details can be found in the journal article 'Correlated spin canting in ordered core-shell Fe_3O_4 / Mn_xFe_(3-x)O_4 nanoparticle assemblies', Physical Review B, volume 99, 094421 (2019).
